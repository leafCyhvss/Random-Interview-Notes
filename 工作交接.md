## 辞职信
Dear Naresh,

I am writing to inform you of my decision to resign from my position as a contractor for Walmart, with my proposed last working day being July 19th. This decision has been made after thorough consideration and due to irreconcilable differences with my current employer.

Working under your leadership and being a part of the CPC INTL team has been a highly rewarding experience. I understand the importance of a smooth transition and will ensure that all pending tasks under my responsibility are appropriately managed. I have been on leave for a few days this week and have made sure to adjust my timesheet accordingly to reflect zero hours.

I would like to schedule a meeting at your earliest convenience to discuss the feasibility of my last working day and ensure it aligns with the team’s needs. Please let me know a suitable time for this discussion.

Thank you for the opportunity to be a part of the team and for all the professional growth I have experienced during my tenure. I regret that my circumstances require this decision and I am grateful for your understanding and support.

Best regards,












Dear Naresh,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to clarify some points regarding my recent resignation notice to ensure there is no misunderstanding about my departure.

Firstly, I want to emphasize that my decision to resign is solely due to personal reasons; I have accepted a full-time job offer that aligns more closely with my long-term plans. This opportunity also allows me to return to California, a region I love and prefer over the Midwest

Regarding my previous mention of 'irreconcilable differences' in my resignation letter, I realize this might have given an unintended impression. I mentioned this out of a concern that Randstad might impose penalties for resigning for personal reasons. However, I want to assure you that there are no actual issues or conflicts with them, and this concern has proven to be unfounded.

I sincerely appreciate the opportunity to have worked under your leadership and be part of the CPC INTL team. My time with the team has been highly rewarding, and I have learned a great deal. 

Thank you once again for your understanding and support. I wish CPC INTL continued success.

I look forward to keeping in touch and hope our paths may cross again in the future.

Warm regards,
Junhui Yang
