## Java Basic

**FunctionalInterface**

```java
@FunctionalInterface
public interface SimpleFunction {
    void doSomething();
}
```

## Spring

1. `@SpringBootApplication`

   This annotation is a combination of `@Configuration`, `@EnableAutoConfiguration`, and `@ComponentScan`. It is used to indicate that a class is a Spring Boot application and enables Spring Boot auto-configuration and component scanning features.

```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class MyApp {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      SpringApplication.run(MyApp.class, args);
   }
}
```

2. `@Configuration`

   This annotation indicates that a class is a Spring configuration class and defines the beans that will be managed by the Spring container.

```java
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
   @Bean
   public MyService myService() {
      return new MyServiceImpl();
   }
}
```

3. `@ComponentScan`

   This annotation is used to specify the packages that should be scanned for Spring components, such as controllers, services, and repositories.

```java
@ComponentScan(basePackages = "com.example.myapp")
public class AppConfig {
}
```

4. `@EnableAutoConfiguration`

   This annotation enables Spring Boot's auto-configuration feature, which automatically configures the Spring application based on the dependencies and the environment.

```java
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableAutoConfiguration
public class MyApp {
   // ...
}
```

## Bean

1. `@Bean`

   This annotation is used to declare a method in a Spring configuration class as a bean that will be managed by the Spring container. It allows the developer to define dependencies and configurations for the bean in the method. Example:

```java
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
   @Bean
   public MyService myService() {
      return new MyServiceImpl();
   }
}
```

2. `@Scope`

   This annotation is used to specify the scope of a bean. It determines the lifecycle and visibility of the bean within the Spring container. The default scope is "singleton". Example:

```java
@Bean
@Scope("prototype")
public MyService myService() {
   return new MyServiceImpl();
}
```

3. `@Lazy`

   This annotation is used to delay the initialization of a bean until it is first used. It can improve the performance of an application by reducing the number of beans that are created and initialized at startup. Example:

```java
@Bean
@Lazy
public MyService myService() {
   return new MyServiceImpl();
}
```

4. `@Primary`

   This annotation is used to indicate that a bean should be given preference when multiple beans of the same type are present. It is commonly used with the `@Autowired` annotation to resolve dependencies when there are multiple beans of the same type. Example:

```java
@Bean
@Primary
public MyService myService1() {
   return new MyServiceImpl1();
}

@Bean
public MyService myService2() {
   return new MyServiceImpl2();
}
```

5. `@Qualifier`

   This annotation is used to specify which bean should be injected when there are multiple beans of the same type. It is commonly used with the `@Autowired` annotation to resolve dependencies. Example:

```java
@Bean
@Qualifier("myServiceImpl1")
public MyService myService1() {
   return new MyServiceImpl1();
}

@Bean
@Qualifier("myServiceImpl2")
public MyService myService2() {
   return new MyServiceImpl2();
}

@Autowired
@Qualifier("myServiceImpl1")
private MyService myService;
```

## Autowiring

1. `@Autowired`

   This annotation allows automatic wiring of dependencies in Spring. It can be used to inject a bean into another bean or to inject a value into a bean. Example code:

```java
@Component
public class MyClass {
   @Autowired
   private MyDependency dependency;
}
```

`@Autowired` and `@Component` are two different Spring annotations with different purposes.

`@Component` is used to mark a class as a Spring component. Spring scans the classpath for classes annotated with `@Component` and creates a Spring bean for each class it finds. These Spring components can be injected into other Spring beans using `@Autowired`.

On the other hand, `@Autowired` is used to inject a Spring bean into another Spring bean. It allows Spring to automatically wire the beans together based on the type of the bean.

In summary, `@Component` is used to mark a class as a Spring component while `@Autowired` is used to inject Spring beans into other Spring beans.

2. `@Resource`

   This annotation is used to autowire a bean by its name. It can be used to inject a bean into another bean or to inject a value into a bean. Example code:

```java
@Component
public class MyClass {
   @Resource(name="myDependency")
   private MyDependency dependency;
}
```

3. `@Inject`

   This annotation is used to autowire dependencies in Spring. It can be used to inject a bean into another bean or to inject a value into a bean. Example code:

```java
@Component
public class MyClass {
   @Inject
   private MyDependency dependency;
}
```

4. `@Value`

   This annotation is used to inject a value into a bean in Spring. It can be used to inject a property value or an environment variable. Example code:

```java
@Component
public class MyClass {
   @Value("${my.property}")
   private String myProperty;
}
```

## Controller

1. `@RestController`

   An annotation used to mark a controller class, indicating that all methods in the controllerrespond to RESTful requests, equivalent to the combination of `@Controller` and `@ResponseBody`.

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api")
public class ApiController {
    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public String hello() {
        return "Hello World!";
    }
}
```

2. `@RequestBody`

   An annotation used to mark a method parameter, indicating that the content of the request body should be converted to the specified type of object.

```java
@PostMapping("/user")
public void addUser(@RequestBody User user) {
    userService.addUser(user);
}
```

3. `@PathVariable`

   An annotation used to mark a method parameter, indicating that the value from a placeholder in the request URL should be used as the method parameter.

```java
@GetMapping("/user/{id}")
public User getUserById(@PathVariable Long id) {
    return userService.getUserById(id);
}
```

4. `@RequestParam`

   An annotation used to mark a method parameter, indicating that the value of a specific parameter in the request should be used as the method parameter.

```java
@GetMapping("/user")
public User getUserById(@RequestParam Long id) {
    return userService.getUserById(id);
}
```

5. `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, `@PutMapping`, `@DeleteMapping`, `@PatchMapping`

   HTTP request mapping annotations in Spring.

   ```java
   @GetMapping("/users")
   public List<User> getAllUsers() {
       return userService.getAllUsers();
   }
   @PostMapping("/users")
   public ResponseEntity<User> createUser(@RequestBody User user) {
       User createdUser = userService.createUser(user);
       return new ResponseEntity<>(createdUser, HttpStatus.CREATED);
   }
   @PutMapping("/users/{id}")
   public ResponseEntity<User> updateUser(@PathVariable Long id, @RequestBody User user) {
       User updatedUser = userService.updateUser(id, user);
       return new ResponseEntity<>(updatedUser, HttpStatus.OK);
   }
   @DeleteMapping("/users/{id}")
   public ResponseEntity<Void> deleteUser(@PathVariable Long id) {
       userService.deleteUser(id);
       return new ResponseEntity<>(HttpStatus.NO_CONTENT);
   }
   @PatchMapping("/users/{id}")
   public ResponseEntity<User> updateUserPartial(@PathVariable Long id, @RequestBody User user) {
       User updatedUser = userService.updateUserPartial(id, user);
       return new ResponseEntity<>(updatedUser, HttpStatus.OK);
   }
   ```

## Service

1. `@Service`

   An annotation used to mark a service class, indicating that the class is a Spring Bean that can be injected into other classes.

```java
@Service
public class UserServiceImpl implements UserService {
    //...
}
```



## DAO

1. `@Repository`

   An annotation used to mark a data access class, indicating that the class is a Spring Bean that can be injected into other classes.

```java
@Repository
public class UserRepositoryImpl implements UserRepository {
    //...
}
```

2. `@Transactional`

   An annotation used to mark a method or class, indicating that the method or all methods in the class should be executed within a transaction, commonly used to manage database transactions.

```java
@Service
@Transactional
public class UserServiceImpl implements UserService {
    //...
}
```

3. `@Column`

   An annotation used to specify the properties of the corresponding columns in the database table.

```java
@Column(columnDefinition = "varchar(255) default 'John Snow'")
private String name;

@Column(name="STUDENT_NAME", length=50, nullable=false, unique=false)
private String studentName; 
```

4. @Entity

   JPA (Java Persistence API) annotation that marks a Java class as an entity, which means it is a mapped object that can be persisted to a database.

   When we add the `@Entity` annotation to a Java class, it indicates that the class will be mapped to a database table. Each instance of the class will be a row in the table and each field will be a column.

   @Id is another commonly used Spring annotation in the context of entity classes. It is used to specify the primary key field of an entity.

   ```java
   @Entity
   public class Customer {
       @Id
       private Long id;
   
       private String name;
   
       private String email;
   
       // Getters and setters
   }
   ```

   

5. @Table

   To map an entity to a database table. It allows developers to specify the details of the table, such as the name, schema, and indexes

   ```java
   @Entity
   @Table(name = "users")
   public class User {
       @Id
       @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
       private Long id;
   
       @Column(name = "first_name")
       private String firstName;
   
       @Column(name = "last_name")
       private String lastName;
   
       // getters and setters
   }
   ```

6. @ManyToOne and @JoinColumn 

7. `@ManyToOne` and `@JoinColumn` are annotations used in JPA (Java Persistence API) to establish a Many-to-One relationship between two entities.

   - `@ManyToOne` is used to define a Many-to-One association from the owning entity to the target entity. It indicates that the current entity (the owning entity) has a Many-to-One relationship with another entity (the target entity).

   - `@JoinColumn` is used to specify the mapping for the foreign key column in the database table. It is typically placed on the owning side of the association and specifies the name of the column that will hold the foreign key.

   Here's an example code snippet to illustrate the usage of `@ManyToOne` and `@JoinColumn`:

   ```java
   @Entity
   public class Employee {
       @Id
       private Long id;
       private String name;
       
       // Other properties and getters/setters
       
       @ManyToOne
       @JoinColumn(name = "department_id")
       private Department department;
       
       // Constructor, getters/setters, etc.
   }
   
   @Entity
   public class Department {
       @Id
       private Long id;
       private String name;
       
       // Other properties and getters/setters
       
       @OneToMany(mappedBy = "department")
       private List<Employee> employees;
       
       // Constructor, getters/setters, etc.
   }
   ```

   In this example, the `Employee` entity has a Many-to-One relationship with the `Department` entity. The `@ManyToOne` annotation is used on the `department` field in the `Employee` entity to establish this relationship. The `@JoinColumn` annotation is used to specify that the foreign key column in the database table for the `Employee` entity should be named `department_id`.

   With this setup, each `Employee` can be associated with a single `Department`, and the `department_id` column in the `Employee` table will hold the foreign key referencing the primary key of the corresponding `Department`.

## Json

1. @JsonProperty("")

A Jackson annotation used in Java to specify the property name of a JSON object during serialization or deserialization. The `@JsonProperty` annotation is used to map a Java field or getter/setter method to a specific key in the JSON data.

```java
public class Person {
    @JsonProperty("name")
    private String firstName;
    @JsonProperty("age")
    private int age;
    
    // getters and setters
}
```

This annotation map the `firstName` field to the key "name" and the `age` field to the key "age" during JSON serialization and deserialization. So, when a `Person` object is serialized to JSON, the resulting JSON object will have properties "name" and "age" instead of "firstName" and "age"
