我目前基本上填完了所有表格，麻烦您审查这些表格如果有不正确的地方，随时联系我修改。同时，我也有一些疑问，记录在下面了，也麻烦您妥善回复

1.我目前没有汽车，Non-Associate Badge Request Form里面我只填写了我的ssn后四位，而没有车辆信息
2. In Direct Deposit Form： 
   It is said: 'The first pay check will be a live check which will be mailed to the address mentioned in your W4.'.
   But I would like to have my first paycheck deposited directly into my bank account
   
   And in row: Bank Name /City /State, I only filled with bank name
3. What are I9 Supporting Documents - 1 and I9 Supporting Documents - 2? What document should I upload？
4. In employee handbook, I can see several types of Employee listed. Am I a full time employee of Infobahn or a independent contractor? 
5. in offer letter I can see:
   'The project start date at client site is 07.24.2024 (contingent on background check and completed paperwork formalities with client) and ... and when the project finishes at the client site the employment of employee would terminate with Employer.'
   
   In our previous emails you told me the company would help me find the next project if the current project end. So does this sentence mean that I would not get paid when I am not working in client's projects, but I will still be a employee of Infobahn and Infobahn would help me get another project?
6. De4 table:
   I am single and have no other income. So it would be:
		Number of allowances for Regular Withholding Allowances, Worksheet A: 1
		Number of allowances from the Estimated Deductions, Worksheet B: 0
		Total Number of Allowances:1 

7. 我注意到employer 信息大多没填，我会再您那边填完后收到更新的表格嘛？


8.  in form Personal Details Form:
   I don't know the detailed physical work location of the client. So I leave it empty. Could you please help me fill in this row and also inform me of it?
   
   




Subject: Questions Regarding Onboarding Paperwork  
  
Dear HR Team,  
  
I hope this message finds you well. I have completed the onboarding paperwork for my new position and would appreciate it if you could review the forms to ensure everything is correct. If there are any issues, please let me know. Additionally, I have some questions listed below that I need assistance with:  
  
1. Non-Associate Badge Request Form: I do not have a car, so I only filled in the last four digits of my SSN and left the vehicle information blank.  
2. Direct Deposit Form:  
   - It is said: "The first pay check will be a live check which will be mailed to the address mentioned in your W4." But I would like to have my first paycheck deposited directly into my bank account.  
   - In the field for Bank Name / City / State, I only filled in the bank name.  
3. I9 Supporting Documents: What are I9 Supporting Documents - 1 and I9 Supporting Documents - 2? What documents should I upload?  
4. Employee Handbook: I see several types of employees listed. Am I a full-time employee of Infobahn or an independent contractor?  
5. Offer Letter:  
   - It states: "The project start date at the client site is 07.24.2024 (contingent on background check and completed paperwork formalities with client) and... and when the project finishes at the client site the employment of the employee would terminate with Employer."  
   - In our previous emails, you mentioned the company would help me find the next project if the current project ends. Does this sentence mean that I would not get paid when I am not working on client projects, but I will still be an employee of Infobahn and Infobahn will help me get another project?  
6. DE4 Table:  
   - I am single and have no other income. So my entries would be:  
     - Number of allowances for Regular Withholding Allowances, Worksheet A: 1  
     - Number of allowances from the Estimated Deductions, Worksheet B: 0  
     - Total Number of Allowances: 1  
7. Employer Information: I noticed that most of the employer information is not filled out. Will I receive an updated form after you fill in these details?  
8. Personal Details Form: I do not know the detailed physical work location of the client, so I left it empty. Could you please help me fill in this row and also inform me of it?  
  
Thank you very much for your time and assistance. I look forward to your response.  
  
Best regards,
