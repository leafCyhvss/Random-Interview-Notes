With Selenium, testers can create robust and reliable automated tests that can be executed across different browsers and platforms. It enables organizations to ensure the quality and functionality of their web applications by automating repetitive tasks, performing cross-browser testing, and detecting potential issues or regressions.

### what is cucumber(youtuebe)?

Cucumber is a popular open-source tool used for behavior-driven development (BDD). It allows for collaboration between developers, testers, and business stakeholders to define and automate test scenarios in a human-readable format. Cucumber uses the Gherkin language, which uses plain-text feature files to describe the behavior of a system using scenarios and steps.

Cucumber integrates with various programming languages and testing frameworks, such as Java, Ruby, and JavaScript, making it versatile and widely adopted in the industry. It promotes collaboration, readability, and test automation, enabling teams to deliver high-quality software with clear communication and shared understanding of requirements.

### what is JMeter(youtube)?

JMeter is an open-source performance testing tool developed by the Apache Software Foundation. It is designed to measure the performance and load of web applications and services. JMeter allows you to simulate heavy loads on web servers, databases, and other resources to analyze their performance under different scenarios.

JMeter supports various protocols, including HTTP, HTTPS, JDBC, FTP, SOAP, and more, making it suitable for testing a wide range of web applications and services. It has a user-friendly GUI for creating and managing test plans, as well as command-line options for running tests in non-GUI mode or integrating with other tools and frameworks.

### what is unit-test?

A unit test is a type of software testing that focuses on testing individual units or components of a software system in isolation. The purpose of unit testing is to verify that each unit of code, such as a function, method, or class, behaves as expected and produces the correct output for a given input.

Unit tests are typically written by developers and executed frequently during the development process. They are designed to test the smallest testable parts of a system and ensure that they function correctly. By isolating units of code and testing them independently, unit tests help identify and fix bugs early in the development cycle, promote code reusability, and provide documentation for the expected behavior of the code.

### What is the lifecircle of Junit?

The lifecycle of JUnit consists of the following phases:

1. Test Setup: In this phase, any necessary setup is performed before executing the test cases. This may include initializing objects, setting up test data, or configuring the test environment.
2. Test Execution: This is the main phase where the actual test cases are executed. Each test case is run independently to validate the behavior of the code under test. Assertions are used to check if the actual output matches the expected output.
3. Test Teardown: After executing each test case, the test environment needs to be cleaned up. This phase involves releasing any acquired resources, closing connections, or resetting the state of the system.
4. Test Result: After executing all the test cases, the results are collected and reported. JUnit provides detailed reports on which test cases passed, failed, or encountered errors. This information helps identify any issues or regressions in the code.

It's important to note that these phases are repeated for each test case, ensuring the isolation and independence of tests. This allows for reliable and reproducible testing of individual units of code.

### Is @BeforeAll method should be Class level(static)?

Yes, the `@BeforeAll` method in JUnit should be a static method at the class level. The `@BeforeAll` annotation is used to indicate that a method should be executed once before any of the test cases in the class are executed. Since this method is invoked before the creation of any instance of the test class, it needs to be a static method.

Here's an example of how to use `@BeforeAll` with a static method:

```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeAll;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

public class MyTestClass {
    
    @BeforeAll
    public static void setUp() {
        // Perform setup tasks
    }

    @Test
    public void myTest() {
        // Test logic
    }
}
```

By marking the `setUp()` method with `@BeforeAll` and making it static, it will be executed once before any test methods in the class are run. This is useful for initializing shared resources or performing costly setup operations that are common to all test cases in the class.

### What is Mockito? and what is its limitations?

Mockito is a popular mocking framework for Java. It allows developers to create mock objects, which are simulated versions of real objects, to facilitate testing. Mockito provides an easy-to-use API for creating and configuring mock objects, stubbing method behaviors, and verifying method invocations.

Mockito has some limitations:

1. Cannot mock final classes or methods: Mockito cannot mock final classes or methods, as it relies on creating dynamic proxies or bytecode manipulation, which is not possible for final elements.
2. Limited support for static methods: Mockito does not have built-in support for mocking static methods. However, there are alternative frameworks like PowerMock that can be used for mocking static methods.
3. Limited support for private methods: Mockito cannot directly mock private methods. It focuses on mocking public methods of objects.
4. Limited support for partial mocking: Mockito does not provide direct support for partial mocking, which involves mocking only a subset of methods of an object while keeping the others intact. However, there are workarounds like using the `spy()` method to partially mock an object.

### What is @Mock and what is @InjectMocks?

In Mockito, `@Mock` and `@InjectMocks` are annotations used to facilitate the creation and injection of mock objects into the test class.

- `@Mock`: The `@Mock` annotation is used to create a mock object of a class or interface. It tells Mockito to create a mock instance of the specified type, which can be used to stub method behaviors and verify method invocations.

- `@InjectMocks`: The `@InjectMocks` annotation is used to automatically inject the mock objects created with `@Mock` into the test class. It identifies the target class where the mocks need to be injected and attempts to match and assign the mock objects based on the type.

By using `@Mock` and `@InjectMocks` together, you can easily create mock objects and inject them into the class under test. This helps in isolating dependencies and controlling their behaviors during testing.

Here's a simple example:

```java
@RunWith(MockitoJUnitRunner.class)
public class MyTestClass {
    
    @Mock
    private MyDependency myDependency;
    
    @InjectMocks
    private MyClass myClass;
    
    @Test
    public void testSomeMethod() {
        // Configure behavior of the mock
        when(myDependency.someMethod()).thenReturn("Mocked value");
        
        // Perform the test on myClass
        String result = myClass.someMethod();
        
        // Assert the result
        assertEquals("Expected result", result);
    }
}
```

In the above example, `@Mock` is used to create a mock object of `MyDependency`, and `@InjectMocks` is used to inject the mock into `myClass`, the class under test. This allows you to control the behavior of `myDependency` during the test.

### What is the stubbing?

Stubbing is the process of defining specific behaviors or return values for method calls on mock objects during unit testing. In other words, it is the act of configuring the mock objects to behave in a certain way when their methods are invoked.

When stubbing, you specify the expected input parameters and define the desired output or behavior of the method being stubbed. This allows you to control the behavior of the mock object and simulate different scenarios for testing.

For example, suppose you have a `UserService` interface with a `getUserById` method that retrieves user information from a database. During testing, you can stub the `getUserById` method to return a specific user object or simulate different responses based on the input.

Here's an example of stubbing using Mockito:

```java
// Create a mock object of UserService
UserService userServiceMock = Mockito.mock(UserService.class);

// Stub the getUserById method
User expectedUser = new User("123", "John");
Mockito.when(userServiceMock.getUserById("123")).thenReturn(expectedUser);

// Invoke the getUserById method
User actualUser = userServiceMock.getUserById("123");

// Assert the result
assertEquals(expectedUser, actualUser);
```

In the above example, the `getUserById` method of the `userServiceMock` object is stubbed to return the `expectedUser` object when invoked with the input `"123"`. This allows you to test the behavior of the code that depends on the `getUserById` method in isolation.

### what is Mockito ArgumentMatchers

Mockito ArgumentMatchers is a utility class provided by the Mockito framework that allows you to define flexible and expressive argument matching when stubbing or verifying method calls on mock objects.

With Mockito ArgumentMatchers, you can specify the expected arguments for method calls on mock objects using various matching methods provided by the `Matchers` class. These matching methods allow you to match arguments based on their types, values, or other conditions.

Some commonly used matching methods include:

- `any()`: Matches any value of the specified type.
- `eq(value)`: Matches the exact value.
- `isNull()`: Matches null values.
- `isNotNull()`: Matches non-null values.
- `startsWith(prefix)`: Matches values that start with the specified prefix.
- `endsWith(suffix)`: Matches values that end with the specified suffix.
- `contains(substring)`: Matches values that contain the specified substring.
- `anyInt()`, `anyString()`, `anyBoolean()`, etc.: Matches any value of the specified primitive or wrapper type.

Here's an example of using Mockito ArgumentMatchers in stubbing:

```java
List<String> mockList = Mockito.mock(List.class);

// Stubbing using ArgumentMatchers
Mockito.when(mockList.get(Mockito.anyInt())).thenReturn("Mocked value");

// Invoke the mocked method
String result = mockList.get(2);

// Assert the result
assertEquals("Mocked value", result);
```

In the above example, the `get` method of the `mockList` object is stubbed to return the string "Mocked value" for any integer argument passed to it using the `anyInt()` matcher.

Mockito ArgumentMatchers provide a convenient way to define flexible argument matching in your tests, allowing you to create more expressive and readable test cases.

### what is Hamcrest Matchers

Hamcrest Matchers is a library that provides a collection of matchers for performing more expressive and readable assertions in unit tests. It works in conjunction with testing frameworks like JUnit and provides an alternative syntax for writing assertions.

Hamcrest Matchers offer a wide range of matchers that can be used to perform various types of assertions. These matchers provide a more fluent and readable way to express the expected outcome of a test.

Here are some examples of Hamcrest Matchers:

- `equalTo(value)`: Matches if the value is equal to the expected value.
- `is(instance)`: Matches if the object is an instance of the specified type.
- `greaterThan(value)`: Matches if the value is greater than the specified value.
- `lessThan(value)`: Matches if the value is less than the specified value.
- `containsString(substring)`: Matches if the string contains the specified substring.
- `hasSize(size)`: Matches if the collection has the specified size.
- `hasProperty(propertyName, matcher)`: Matches if the object has a property with the specified name that matches the provided matcher.

Hamcrest Matchers can be used in combination with other testing frameworks, such as JUnit or Mockito, to write more expressive and readable assertions. They provide a rich set of options for creating custom matchers and can be easily extended to fit specific testing needs.

Example usage of Hamcrest Matchers:

```java
import static org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert.assertThat;
import static org.hamcrest.Matchers.*;

// ...

@Test
public void testExample() {
    String str = "Hello, World!";
    assertThat(str, is(notNullValue()));
    assertThat(str, containsString("Hello"));
    assertThat(str.length(), greaterThan(5));
}
```

In the above example, Hamcrest Matchers are used to assert that a string is not null, contains a specific substring, and has a length greater than 5. The `assertThat` method is used to perform the assertion using the Hamcrest Matchers.

### do you know @spy? what is difference between @spy and @Mock?

The `@Mock` annotation is used to create a mock object for a class or interface. It allows you to define the behavior of the mock object and specify the return values for its methods. With `@Mock`, the actual methods of the mocked object are not invoked, and the default values or specified behavior is returned instead.

On the other hand, the `@Spy` annotation is used to create a partial mock object. It allows you to spy on a real object and selectively override its behavior for certain methods while retaining the original behavior for others. When using `@Spy`, the real methods of the object are invoked unless they are specifically stubbed or overridden.

In summary:
- `@Mock` creates a complete mock object where all methods are mocked by default.
- `@Spy` creates a partial mock object where real methods are invoked unless they are stubbed or overridden.

In general, `@Mock` is commonly used when you want to completely replace a dependency with a mock object, while `@Spy` is used when you want to partially mock an object and still have access to its original behavior.
