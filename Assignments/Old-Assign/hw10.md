### What is the authentication?

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. It ensures that the entity trying to access a resource or perform an action is indeed who or what it claims to be. Authentication is a crucial component of security systems and helps protect sensitive information and resources from unauthorized access.

In the context of web applications, authentication typically involves the following steps:

1. User provides credentials: The user submits their username and password or other authentication credentials.

2. Credentials verification: The system validates the provided credentials against the stored user data, such as a database or user directory.

3. Authentication result: If the credentials are valid, the user is considered authenticated, and access is granted. Otherwise, authentication fails, and access is denied.

Common authentication mechanisms include username/password authentication, token-based authentication (e.g., JSON Web Tokens), and certificate-based authentication. Depending on the system and requirements, additional factors such as two-factor authentication or biometric authentication can be used to enhance security.

Authentication is often used in combination with authorization, which determines what actions or resources a user is allowed to access after successful authentication.

### What is the authorization?

Authorization is the process of granting or denying access to specific resources or actions based on the authenticated user's privileges, roles, or permissions. It ensures that users can only access the resources or perform actions that they are authorized to, according to the defined rules and policies.

In the context of web applications, authorization typically involves the following:

1. Authentication: The user's identity is verified through the authentication process.

2. Access control: Once authenticated, the system checks the user's authorization to perform certain operations or access specific resources.

3. Authorization rules: These rules define which users or user groups have permission to perform specific actions or access certain resources. These rules can be based on roles, permissions, or other criteria.

4. Granting or denying access: Based on the authorization rules, the system grants or denies access to the requested resource or action.

Authorization helps ensure the security and integrity of a system by preventing unauthorized access and protecting sensitive information. It is often implemented using access control lists (ACLs), role-based access control (RBAC), or other access control mechanisms.

### What is the difference between authentication and authorization?

Also see in pdf pictures.

Authentication and authorization are two distinct processes related to security in software systems:

Authentication:
- Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or entity.
- It ensures that the user is who they claim to be.
- It typically involves the user providing credentials (e.g., username and password) to prove their identity.
- The goal of authentication is to establish trust and validate the user's identity before granting access to the system.

Authorization:
- Authorization is the process of granting or denying access to specific resources or actions.
- It determines what a user is allowed to do or access within a system after authentication.
- It is based on the permissions, roles, or privileges associated with the authenticated user.
- The goal of authorization is to enforce access control and ensure that users have appropriate permissions to perform certain actions or access specific resources.

In summary, authentication focuses on verifying identity, while authorization focuses on controlling access to resources based on the authenticated identity. Both processes are essential for ensuring the security and integrity of a system.

### What is HTTP Session?

HTTP Session is a mechanism in web development that allows the server to store user-specific data across multiple HTTP requests. It enables the server to maintain stateful interactions with clients in a stateless protocol like HTTP.

More key points about HTTP Session:

1. Stateful Session: HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning it does not retain information between requests. HTTP Session introduces statefulness by associating a unique session identifier (usually a session cookie) with each user. This identifier is sent back and forth between the client and server to identify the session.

2. Server-Side Storage: The session data is stored on the server side in memory or other storage systems (e.g., databases). Each session has a separate storage area for storing session attributes.

3. User Identification: The session identifier allows the server to associate session data with a specific user. This enables the server to recognize and track user-specific information during a session, such as user preferences, authentication status, shopping cart contents, etc.

4. Session Management: The server handles session creation, tracking, and expiration. It assigns a unique session identifier to each new user or session and manages the lifecycle of the session. Sessions can expire after a period of inactivity or based on a predefined timeout.

5. Cross-Page Data Transfer: HTTP Session enables the transfer of data between different pages or requests within the same session. Data can be stored in the session on one page and retrieved on subsequent pages, allowing for seamless user interactions.

HTTP Session provides a way to maintain user-specific data and state within web applications, facilitating personalized experiences and enhanced functionality.

### What is Cookie?

A cookie is a small piece of data that is stored on the client-side (user's browser) by a web server. It is used to store information about the user or their interaction with a website. Cookies are sent back and forth between the client and server with each HTTP request and response.

More key points about cookies:

1. Client-Side Storage: Cookies are stored on the client-side as text files. Each cookie consists of a name-value pair and optional attributes such as expiration date, domain, and path.


2. User Tracking: Cookies are often used for tracking user behavior and maintaining user sessions. They can store information such as user preferences, authentication tokens, session IDs, and shopping cart contents.

3. Persistent or Session-Based: Cookies can be persistent or session-based. Persistent cookies have an expiration date and remain stored on the client-side even after the browser is closed. Session cookies are temporary and expire when the user closes the browser.

4. Server-Side Usage: When a client sends an HTTP request to a server, it includes any relevant cookies associated with the domain. The server can access these cookies and use the information for various purposes, such as personalizing the user's experience, maintaining user sessions, or tracking analytics.

5. Privacy and Security: Cookies can raise privacy concerns as they can be used to track user activity across multiple websites. To address privacy issues, modern web browsers provide options to block or manage cookies. Additionally, secure cookies can be used with HTTPS to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the cookie data.

### What is the difference between Session and Cookie?

(simpler answer):
sessions are server-side data storage mechanisms, while cookies are client-side files used for storing small amounts of data. Sessions are typically used for managing user sessions and maintaining stateful interactions, while cookies are often used for user tracking, personalization, and storing user preferences.

---------------------------

(more detailed version:)

1. Data Storage: Session data is stored on the server-side, typically in memory or a database, while cookie data is stored on the client-side as text files.
2. Data Size: Cookies have a size limit (usually around 4KB), whereas session data can be larger and more flexible.
3. Security: Session data is generally considered more secure as it is not exposed to the client-side, while cookies can be accessed and manipulated by the user or other scripts.
4. Persistence: Sessions are temporary and expire after a certain period of inactivity or when the user closes the browser, while cookies can be persistent and remain on the user's device until they expire or are manually deleted.

Session:
- Session is a server-side mechanism to track the state of a user's interaction with a website.
- A session is established when a user visits a website and is assigned a unique session ID.
- The session ID is stored on the server, typically in memory or a database, and associated with the user's session data.
- The session ID is usually passed to the client as a cookie, but it can also be included in the URL or form data.
- The client's browser sends the session ID with each subsequent request to the server, allowing the server to retrieve the associated session data and maintain the user's state.
- Sessions are typically used to store sensitive data or user-specific information, such as authentication status, user preferences, or shopping cart contents.
- Sessions are managed by the server and have a default expiration time or can be manually invalidated.

Cookie:
- Cookie is a small piece of data stored on the client-side (user's browser) by a web server.
- Cookies are used to store information about the user or their interaction with a website.
- Cookies are sent back and forth between the client and server with each HTTP request and response.
- Cookies can be persistent (stored on the client-side even after the browser is closed) or session-based (temporary and expire when the user closes the browser).
- Cookies are typically used for purposes like user tracking, session management, personalization, or storing user preferences.
- Cookies are managed by the client's browser, and the server can read and write cookies by including them in the HTTP headers.
- Cookies can be set, modified, or deleted by the server or client-side JavaScript.

In summary, sessions are server-side mechanisms to maintain user state, while cookies are client-side data storage mechanisms used to store information sent between the client and server. Sessions rely on cookies to maintain the session ID, but they serve different purposes in web application development.

### How do we use session and cookie to keep user information across the the application?

1. When a user logs in or provides their information, store the relevant data in the session object on the server-side. This can include user ID, name, roles, or any other required information.

2. Generate a unique session ID and send it to the client as a cookie. The cookie will be automatically included in subsequent requests to the server.

3. On each request, retrieve the session ID from the cookie sent by the client. Use the session ID to look up the corresponding session data on the server-side.

4. Validate the session and authorize the user based on the stored session data. If the session is invalid or expired, prompt the user to log in again.

5. Access the user information stored in the session to personalize the user experience, enforce authorization rules, or provide relevant content.

### What is JWT?

JWT (JSON Web Token) is an open standard for securely transmitting information between parties as a compact and self-contained token. It is commonly used for authentication and authorization purposes in web applications.

### What is the spring security filter?

A component that intercepts incoming requests and outgoing responses to perform specific security-related tasks. The Spring Security filter chain consists of a series of filters that are applied to requests and responses in a specific order. Each filter performs a specific security operation, such as authentication, authorization, session management, CSRF protection, etc. The filters work together to provide a comprehensive security layer for web applications. Developers can customize the filter chain by adding, removing, or modifying filters to meet their specific security requirements.

### decribe how do JWT work

slides 26页图
JWT (JSON Web Token) is a compact and self-contained token format used for secure transmission of information between parties as a JSON object. It consists of three parts: a header, a payload, and a signature. Here's how JWT works:

1. Authentication: When a user authenticates with credentials, the server generates a JWT containing relevant user information and signs it with a secret key.
2. Token Issuance: The server sends the JWT to the client, who stores it (e.g., in local storage or cookies) for subsequent requests.
3. Request Authorization: The client includes the JWT in the request's Authorization header or as a query parameter.
4. Token Verification: The server receives the request and extracts the JWT. It verifies the token's signature using the secret key.
5. Payload Validation: The server checks the token's expiration, issuer, and other claims to ensure its validity.
6. User Authentication: If the token is valid, the server extracts user information from the JWT, allowing the user to access protected resources.
7. Token Renewal: If needed, the client can request a new JWT by sending a refresh token (if provided) to the server.

JWTs provide stateless authentication and authorization, as the server does not need to maintain session information. Instead, the server can validate the JWT and extract necessary information from it to authenticate and authorize the user.

### Do you use any Encoder to encode Password?

1. BCryptPasswordEncoder: This encoder uses the BCrypt hashing algorithm, which is considered to be highly secure. It automatically generates a random salt and performs multiple iterations of the hashing process.
2. PasswordEncoderFactories: This is a factory class that provides a convenient way to create instances of various password encoders. It supports different password storage formats, such as bcrypt, scrypt, and SHA-256.
3. StandardPasswordEncoder: This encoder uses the SHA-256 hashing algorithm with additional random salt. However, it is not recommended for new applications as bcrypt or scrypt are considered more secure.

### What is UserDetailService? AuthenticationProvider?AuthenticationManager? AuthenticationFilter?

(把这⼏个名字看熟悉也⾏)

1. UserDetailService: Responsible for loading user-specific data during authentication.
2. AuthenticationProvider: Authenticates a user based on provided credentials.
3. AuthenticationManager: Coordinates the authentication process by delegating to AuthenticationProviders.
4. AuthenticationFilter: Processes authentication requests and passes them to the AuthenticationManager.

### What is the disadvantage of Session? how to overcome the disadvantage?

Disadvantage

It introduces server-side state, which can lead to scalability and performance issues in distributed systems. Additionally, session-based authentication may not be suitable for stateless architectures or microservices.

Solution:

stateless authentication mechanisms like JWT (JSON Web Tokens) can be used. JWTs store user authentication information as claims within the token itself, eliminating the need for server-side session management. JWTs can be securely generated and verified using cryptographic algorithms, making them self-contained and eliminating the need for server-side state storage.

By adopting stateless authentication with JWTs, the disadvantages of server-side session management can be mitigated, resulting in better scalability, improved performance, and compatibility with distributed and stateless architectures.

### how to get value from application.properties?

We can retrieve values from the `application.properties` file using the `@Value` annotation or the `Environment` object.

1. Using the `@Value` annotation:
   - Declare a field in your class and annotate it with `@Value("${property.name}")`, where `property.name` is the key of the property in the `application.properties` file.
   - Spring will inject the value of the property into the annotated field.

   ```java
   @Value("${myapp.username}")
   private String username;
   ```

2. Using the `Environment` object:
   - Inject the `Environment` object into your class.
   - Use the `getProperty("property.name")` method to retrieve the value of the property.

   ```java
   @Autowired
   private Environment environment;
   
   public void someMethod() {
       String username = environment.getProperty("myapp.username");
   }
   ```

### What is the role of configure(HttpSecurity http) and configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)?

`configure(HttpSecurity http)`:

- This method is used to configure the security settings for different HTTP requests.
- Inside this method, we can define access rules, authentication requirements, session management, CSRF protection, and more.
- We can specify which URLs should be secured, which URLs should be allowed without authentication, and define role-based or permission-based access restrictions.

`configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)`:

- This method is used to configure the authentication mechanism.
- Inside this method, We can define how the application should authenticate users, such as using in-memory user credentials, a database, or an external authentication provider.
- We can configure authentication providers, user details services, password encoders, and customize the authentication process.
