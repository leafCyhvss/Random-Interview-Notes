When you have multiple `ExecutorService` instances running their own batches, you can implement several strategies to ensure safe and efficient processing. Hereâ€™s how you can put a "safety net" in place:

### 1. **Use a Centralized Task Queue (Work Stealing or BlockingQueue):**

   - **Work-Stealing Pool**: Java provides a `ForkJoinPool` with a work-stealing mechanism, which dynamically balances the load among multiple executor services. This allows idle threads in one `ExecutorService` to "steal" tasks from busy threads in another.
   
   - **BlockingQueue**: If you're using multiple `ExecutorService` instances, you can coordinate them through a shared `BlockingQueue`. Tasks are submitted to this centralized queue, and each executor pulls tasks as they become available, ensuring that no single executor service is overwhelmed.

   ```java
   BlockingQueue<Runnable> taskQueue = new LinkedBlockingQueue<>();
   
   // ExecutorService 1
   ExecutorService executor1 = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);
   executor1.submit(() -> {
       while (true) {
           try {
               Runnable task = taskQueue.take(); // Take a task from the queue
               task.run();
           } catch (InterruptedException e) {
               Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
           }
       }
   });

   // ExecutorService 2
   ExecutorService executor2 = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);
   executor2.submit(() -> {
       while (true) {
           try {
               Runnable task = taskQueue.take(); // Take a task from the queue
               task.run();
           } catch (InterruptedException e) {
               Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
           }
       }
   });

   // Submit tasks to the shared queue
   taskQueue.put(() -> System.out.println("Task 1"));
   taskQueue.put(() -> System.out.println("Task 2"));
   ```

### 2. **Rate Limiting:**

   - Implement rate limiting to control the rate at which tasks are submitted to each `ExecutorService`. This ensures that no executor is overwhelmed with tasks at a faster rate than it can process them.

   - You can use tools like `Semaphore` to limit the number of concurrent tasks being processed across multiple executors.

   ```java
   Semaphore semaphore = new Semaphore(10); // Allow up to 10 concurrent tasks
   
   executorService.submit(() -> {
       try {
           semaphore.acquire();
           // Process task
       } finally {
           semaphore.release();
       }
   });
   ```

### 3. **Centralized Task Dispatcher (Master-Worker Pattern):**

   - Implement a master thread or service that acts as a dispatcher. This master can manage the load and distribute tasks to different `ExecutorService` instances based on their current load or priority.

   - The master can also implement backpressure by temporarily halting task distribution if all executors are busy, thereby avoiding overload.

   ```java
   class TaskDispatcher {
       private final List<ExecutorService> executors;

       public TaskDispatcher(List<ExecutorService> executors) {
           this.executors = executors;
       }

       public void dispatchTask(Runnable task) {
           // Simple round-robin distribution
           int leastLoaded = getLeastLoadedExecutor();
           executors.get(leastLoaded).submit(task);
       }

       private int getLeastLoadedExecutor() {
           // Logic to determine which executor has the least load
           // This could be based on queue size, active threads, etc.
           return 0; // Simplified example
       }
   }

   TaskDispatcher dispatcher = new TaskDispatcher(Arrays.asList(executor1, executor2, executor3));
   dispatcher.dispatchTask(() -> System.out.println("Task"));
   ```

### 4. **Thread and Resource Monitoring:**

   - Use monitoring tools (like JMX, custom metrics) to monitor the health of each `ExecutorService`. If a certain threshold is crossed (e.g., too many active threads, queue size too large), you can dynamically adjust the thread pool sizes or redistribute the load.

   - Implement a health check mechanism that can pause or stop task submission to an `ExecutorService` if it becomes overloaded.

### 5. **Graceful Degradation:**

   - Implement fallback mechanisms where less critical tasks are delayed or discarded when system resources are constrained. This ensures critical tasks are always processed even under heavy load.

   - Prioritize tasks so that critical tasks are processed first, and less important ones can be deferred.

### Summary:

- **Centralized Queue**: Share tasks among multiple executor services using a blocking queue.
- **Rate Limiting**: Control the task submission rate to each executor service.
- **Task Dispatcher**: Use a central dispatcher to balance load across multiple executors.
- **Monitoring**: Continuously monitor the system to detect and respond to overloads.
- **Graceful Degradation**: Prioritize and manage task processing under heavy load conditions.

These strategies help maintain a manageable number of active threads and ensure that resources are used efficiently, preventing overload in a system with multiple `ExecutorService` instances.
